## Project Status

This mod is currently not being updated to newer Minecraft versions.

I'm researching how to support multiple Minecraft versions (such as 1.21.x) in a single `.jar` file, so I don't have to maintain separate builds for each sub-version. This takes time to get right, especially with how Minecraft and Fabric handle internal changes.

On top of that, I'm currently busy with other work and responsibilities, so updates will be delayed for a while.

The mod should still work as intended on the version it was built for. If you're a developer and want to contribute or experiment with multi-version support, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
